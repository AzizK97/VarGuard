Intelligent Network Security Monitor with
AI Assistant
November 2025
Abstract
This project aims to develop a beta version of an intelligent network monitoring
platform that combines real-time intrusion detection, network scanning, and AIassisted recommendations. Using Suricata IDS, Spring Boot, React, Docker, and
K3s, the system integrates the Hugging Face API to analyze security alerts and
suggest corrective actions. The project will be developed collaboratively by four
students over two months, focusing on essential features and practical deployment.

Introduction

Network monitoring and cybersecurity remain major challenges in IT infrastructures.
This project proposes a lightweight, intelligent system that automatically detects network anomalies and provides recommendations using an AI assistant. The application
integrates:
• Suricata IDS for real-time intrusion detection.
• Spring Boot backend for data processing and API management.
• Hugging Face API for generating AI-based security advice.
• React.js Dashboard for visualization.
• Docker + K3s for containerized, scalable deployment.

System Architecture

Component Description
1. Suricata: Captures network traffic and produces alerts.
2. Elasticsearch: Stores Suricata alerts for quick search and analysis.
3. Spring Boot Backend: Exposes REST APIs, runs Nmap scans, queries Hugging
Face API, and communicates with Elasticsearch.
4. React Dashboard: Displays alerts, network map, and AI suggestions.
5. Hugging Face API: Interprets alerts and provides remediation text using a model
like Mistral-7B-Instruct.
6. Docker + K3s: Each component runs in a container, and K3s orchestrates the
microservices in a lightweight Kubernetes environment.

Technologies Used
• Backend: Java, Spring Boot, RESTful APIs.
• Frontend: React.js, Chakra UI.
• AI Integration: Hugging Face Inference API.
• Network Tools: Suricata IDS, Nmap.
• Database & Indexing: PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch.

• Deployment: Docker, K3s (Lightweight Kubernetes), Docker Compose.
• Version Control: Git + GitHub.

Main Features
• Network Scanning: Discover devices and open ports via Nmap.
• Intrusion Detection: Real-time detection of suspicious activities using Suricata.
• AI Assistance: Generate recommended countermeasures using Hugging Face
models.
• Web Dashboard: Monitor alerts, view device information, and display AI-generated
insights.
• Containerized Deployment: Use Docker containers managed through K3s for
modular scalability.

Collaborative Task Distribution

Each student participates in all key areas of development through coordinated work
phases:
Phase
1:
Setup & Environment

All members configure Docker, K3s cluster, GitHub
repo, and basic project structure.

Phase
2:
Backend Development

Each member implements a module in Spring Boot:
• Member 1: API structure and alert management.
• Member 2: Nmap integration service.
• Member 3: Hugging Face API service.
• Member 4: Database + Elasticsearch integration.

Phase 3: Frontend Development

All members contribute React components:
• Member 1: Dashboard layout.
• Member 2: Alert visualization.
• Member 3: Device list + scan results.
• Member 4: AI recommendation interface.

Phase 4: Deployment
&
Integration

All work on Docker images, Compose setup, and deploy
microservices on K3s cluster. Testing and debugging are
shared.

Phase 5: Documentation &
Presentation

Each contributes to the technical documentation, architecture diagram, and final project demo.
